# wellbeing-lab
AI-based emotional wellbeing assistant for organizational health. Concept project developed during the Building AI course. Focused on preventive mental health, empathy, and intelligent interaction at work.

**Conceptual project developed as part of the "Building AI" course by the University of Helsinki.**

## üåø What the project does

**Wellbeing-lab** is a conceptual exploration of an AI-powered assistant designed to promote emotional wellbeing in organizational settings. It imagines a digital companion that supports employees through lightweight, proactive, and human-centered interactions.

## üí° Why the project is useful

Organizations today struggle with employee engagement, emotional health, and psychological safety. This project addresses those challenges through a solution that could:

- Facilitate emotional check-ins and contextual nudges
- Deliver personalized micro-learning content
- Foster community and cultural connection
- Act as an ethical and confidential communication bridge

## üöÄ How users can get started with the project

This is a conceptual repository and does not contain executable code. Users interested in the concept are encouraged to:

- Read the project description in this README
- Explore similar products (e.g., Calm, Headway, Welltory, LinkedIn's workplace mental health initiatives)
- Watch the film *Her* (2013) for philosophical inspiration
- Reflect on how AI can enable empathy and mental resilience

## üß≠ Where users can get help with the project

Currently, this project is not under active development. For discussions or future iterations, users may follow updates through future releases.

## üõ†Ô∏è Who maintains and contributes to the project

This project was created by **Helder Duarte Costa**.

## üìö Additional Inspiration

This project was inspired by a blend of real-life corporate experiences and references such as:

- **Her** (film by Spike Jonze)
- **Calm**, **Headway**, **Welltory**
- Workplace emotional wellbeing content shared in the workplace

## üö´ Disclaimer

This repository is not intended as a technical implementation. It does not include source code, AI logic, or architectural design. The intellectual property of any functional version remains with its author. This is for academic and conceptual purposes only.

## üß† Data and AI Techniques

The project is based on the conceptual use of AI techniques such as sentiment analysis, context-aware recommendation engines, and lightweight conversational agents. It assumes local data processing for privacy, with real-time emotional state estimation from usage patterns and language. No actual data is used or collected in this conceptual version.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Challenges

This project does not aim to replace mental health professionals or serve clinical purposes. It cannot ensure accurate diagnosis or emotional interpretation. Also, adoption depends on cultural acceptance, trust in AI, and organizational support. Privacy management and user transparency would be critical implementation challenges.

## üîÆ What Next

In the future, Wellbeing-lab could evolve into a modular app prototype tested within real corporate environments. It could integrate wearables, offer emotional analytics dashboards to HR (with consent), and support integrations with Slack, Teams or similar tools. Research partnerships and feedback loops could help improve accuracy and impact.
